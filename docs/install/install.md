# Installation

## Pre-Requisites

!!! Tip "Using Windows?"

    If you are on a Windows machine, we recommend using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) to benefit from all the features of quacc.

1. Install Python 3.9+, preferably in conjunction with an environment manager. For instance, download and run the [Miniconda installer](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. When asked to add Miniconda to your `PATH`, select yes
3. Create a fresh Python environment by running `conda create -n quacc python=3.10`
4. Activate this environment via `conda activate quacc`

## Installing quacc

In your newly activated conda environment, run the following commands to install quacc. Note that you will need to install quacc on all machines where you plan to run calculations.

For the latest PyPI release:

```bash
pip install quacc
```

For the development version:

```bash
pip install "quacc @ git+https://github.com/quantum-accelerators/quacc.git"
```
