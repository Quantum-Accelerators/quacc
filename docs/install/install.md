# Installation

## Pre-Requisites

!!! note

    If you are on a Windows machine, you will need to install and use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://ubuntu.com/wsl).

1. Install Python, preferably in conjunction with an environment manager. For instance, download and run the [Miniconda installer](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. When asked to add Miniconda to your `PATH`, select yes
3. Create a fresh Python environment by running `conda create -n quacc python=3.10`
4. Activate this environment via `conda activate quacc`

## Installing quacc

In your newly activated conda environment, run the following commands to install quacc. Note that you will need to install quacc on all machines where you plan to run calculations.

```bash
# Install development version of quacc
pip install git+https://github.com/quantum-accelerators/quacc.git
```

!!! Tip

    Everything beyond this point in the installation guide is to add on useful features to quacc. So, if you are just getting started, check out the [Quacc Basics](../user/basics.md) page. Then come back to installing additional features as you need them.
