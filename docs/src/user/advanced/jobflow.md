# Using Quacc with Jobflow

## Introduction

[Jobflow](https://github.com/materialsproject/jobflow) is a program developed by the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/) team to write computational workflows. It can be used in place of Covalent, if preferred.

Make sure you completed the ["Jobflow Setup"](../../install/advanced/jobflow.md) section of the installation instructions. Additionally, you should read the Jobflow documentation's [Quick Start](https://materialsproject.github.io/jobflow/tutorials/1-quickstart.html) to get a sense of how Jobflow works. Namely, you should understand the `Job` and `Flow` definitions, which describe individual compute tasks and workflows, respectively.

```{seealso}
For a more detailed tutorial on how to use Jobflow, refer to the [Jobflow Tutorials](https://materialsproject.github.io/jobflow/tutorials) and [this helpful guide](https://github.com/JaGeo/Advanced_Jobflow_Tutorial) written by Dr. Janine George.
```

### Running a Job

Here, we will try running a simple job where we carry out a static calculation on a bulk Cu structure using EMT. This example is shown below.

```python
import jobflow as jf
from ase.build import bulk
from quacc.recipes.emt.core import static_job

# Make an Atoms object of a bulk Cu structure
atoms = bulk("Cu")

# Define the compute job
job = jf.job(static_job)(atoms)

# Run the job locally
responses = jf.run_locally(job, create_folders=True)

# Get the result
result = responses[job.uuid][1].output
print(result)
```

The key thing to note is that we need to transform the Quacc recipe, which is a normal function, into a `Job` object. This can be done using the `@job` decorator and a new function definition or, more compactly, via `jf.job(<function>)`. We chose to run the job locally, but other workflow managers supported by Jobflow can be imported and used.

```{note}
Even though the Quacc recipes are defined as Covalent `Electron` objects via the `@ct.electron` decorator, this decorator will be ignored when using Jobflow.
```

### Running a Flow

Here, we will try running a simple workflow where we relax a bulk Cu structure using EMT and take the output of that calculation as the input to a follow-up static calculation with EMT. This example is shown below.

```python
import jobflow as jf
from ase.build import bulk
from quacc.recipes.emt.core import relax_job, static_job

# Make an Atoms object of a bulk Cu structure
atoms = bulk("Cu")

# Define the compute jobs
job1 = jf.job(relax_job)(atoms)
job2 = jf.job(static_job)(job1.output["atoms"])

# Define the workflow
workflow = jf.Flow([job1, job2])

# Run the workflow locally
responses = jf.run_locally(workflow, create_folders=True)

# Get the result
result = responses[job2.uuid][1].output
print(result)
```

Like before, we need to define the individual `Job` objects. Now though, we must stitch them together into a `Flow`, which can be easily achieved by passing them to the `jf.Flow()` constructor. The `Flow` object will automatically determine the order in which the jobs should be run based on the inputs and outputs of each job. In this case, it will know not to run `job2` until `job1` has completed.

### Running a Workflow with Complex Connectivity

For this example, let's consider a toy scenario where we wish to relax a bulk Cu structure, carve all possible slabs, and then run a new relaxation calculation on each slab.

In Quacc, there are two types of recipes: 1) individual compute tasks that are functions; 2) workflows that are classes. Here, we are interested in importing a workflow, so it will be instantiated slightly differently from the prior examples. See the example below:

```python
import jobflow as jf
from ase.build import bulk
from quacc.recipes.emt.core import relax_job
from quacc.recipes.emt.slabs import BulkToSlabsFlow

@jf.job
def relax_func(atoms):

    return relax_job(atoms)

@jf.job
def bulk_to_slabs_func(atoms):

    return BulkToSlabsFlow(slab_static_electron=None).run(atoms)


# Define the Atoms object
atoms = bulk("Cu")

# Construct the Flow
job1 = relax_func(atoms)
job2 = bulk_to_slabs_func(job1.output["atoms"])
workflow = jf.Flow([job1, job2])

# Run the workflow locally
responses = jf.run_locally(workflow, create_folders=True)

# Get the result
result = responses[job2.uuid][1].output
print(result)
```

```{note}
Here, we have used the `@jf.job` decorator instead of the `jf.job()` shorthand because it is not possible to convert a class to a `Job` object using the shorthand.
```

We have imported the {obj}`.emt.slabs.BulkToSlabsFlow` class, which is instantiated with optional parameters and is applied to an `Atoms` object. Here, for demonstration purposes, we specify the `slab_static_electron=None` option to do a relaxation but disable the static calculation on each slab. All we have to do to define the workflow is stitch together the individual `@job` steps into a single `Flow` object.

### Known Limitations

When running a Covalent-based class like {obj}`.emt.slabs.BulkToSlabsFlow` in the previous example, the entire class will run as a single compute task even though it is composed of several individual sub-tasks. If these sub-tasks are compute-intensive, this might not be the most efficient use of resources.

To address this, you can draw inspiration from the Covalent-based classes to design your own workflows tailored to Jobflow. After all, it only requires you to stitch together the individual `@job` steps into a single `Flow`.

```{seealso}
For details on how to write your own dynamic workflows in Jobflow, refer to the [corresponding tutorial](https://materialsproject.github.io/jobflow/tutorials/5-dynamic-flows.html) in the Jobflow documentation.
```

If you wish to construct Jobflow-specific workflows that are mirrors of their Covalent counterparts, this is fully supported by Quacc. Refer to the {obj}`quacc.recipes.emt.jobflow.slabs` module for a representative Jobflow example that can be compared against the Covalent version at {obj}`quacc.recipes.emt.slabs`.
