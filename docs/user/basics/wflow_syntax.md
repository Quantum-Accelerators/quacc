# Workflow Syntax

## Introduction

Here, we provide code snippets for several decorator-based workflow engines. For a comparison of the pros and cons of each approach, refer to the [Workflow Engines Overview](wflow_overview.md) page. We describe the specifics of how to use each workflow engine in more detail later in the documentation.

## Background

To help enable interoperability between workflow engines, quacc offers a unified set of decorators: [`#!Python @job`](https://quantum-accelerators.github.io/quacc/reference/quacc/wflow_tools/decorators.html#quacc.wflow_tools.decorators.job), [`#!Python @flow`](https://quantum-accelerators.github.io/quacc/reference/quacc/wflow_tools/decorators.html#quacc.wflow_tools.decorators.flow), and [`#!Python @subflow`](https://quantum-accelerators.github.io/quacc/reference/quacc/wflow_tools/decorators.html#quacc.wflow_tools.decorators.subflow).

=== "Parsl"

    Take a moment to read the Parsl documentation's ["Quick Start"](https://parsl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html) to get a sense of how Parsl works. Namely, you should understand the concept of a [`#!Python python_app`](https://parsl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/1-parsl-introduction.html#Python-Apps) and [`#!Python join_app`](https://parsl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/1-parsl-introduction.html?highlight=join_app#Dynamic-workflows-with-apps-that-generate-other-apps), which describe individual compute tasks and dynamic job tasks, respectively.

    | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
    | `#!Python @job`     | `#!Python @python_app` |
    | `#!Python @flow`    | No effect              |
    | `#!Python @subflow` | `#!Python @join_app`   |

=== "Covalent"

    Take a moment to learn about the main [Covalent Concepts](https://docs.covalent.xyz/docs/user-documentation/concepts/concepts-index), namely the [`#!Python @ct.electron`](https://docs.covalent.xyz/docs/user-documentation/concepts/covalent-basics#electron) and [`#!Python @ct.lattice`](https://docs.covalent.xyz/docs/user-documentation/concepts/covalent-basics#lattice) decorators, which describe individual compute tasks and workflows, respectively.

    | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `#!Python @job`     | `#!Python @ct.electron`                                |
    | `#!Python @flow`    | `#!Python @ct.lattice`                                 |
    | `#!Python @subflow` | `#!Python @ct.electron`<br>`#!Python @ct.lattice`</br> |

    </center>

=== "Dask"

    Take a moment to read the Dask Delayed documentation [overview page](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/delayed.html) to get a sense of how the Dask decorators works and the Dask Distributed [quickstart page](https://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/quickstart.html) to understand how to submit tasks to a Dask cluster. Namely, you should understand the `#!Python @delayed` decorator and how to interface with the `Client`.

    <center>

    | Quacc               | Covalent                          |
    | ------------------- | ---------------------------------|
    | `#!Python @job`     | `#!Python @delayed`               |
    | `#!Python @flow`    | No effect                         |
    | `#!Python @subflow` | `#!Python delayed(...).compute()` |

    </center>

=== "Redun"

    Take a moment to read the Redun documentation's [Design Overview page](https://insitro.github.io/redun/design.html) to get a sense of how Redun works. Namely, you should understand the `Task` decorator and how to interface with the `Scheduler`.

    <center>

    | Quacc               | Redun            |
    | ------------------- | ---------------- |
    | `#!Python @job`     | `#!Python @task` |
    | `#!Python @flow`    | `#!Python @task` |
    | `#!Python @subflow` | `#!Python @task` |

    </center>

=== "Jobflow"

    Take a moment to read the Jobflow documentation's [Quick Start](https://materialsproject.github.io/jobflow/tutorials/1-quickstart.html) to get a sense of how Jobflow works. Namely, you should understand the `Job` and `Flow` definitions, which describe individual compute tasks and workflows, respectively.

    <center>

    | Quacc               | Jobflow         |
    | ------------------- | --------------- |
    | `#!Python @job`     | `#!Python @job` |
    | `#!Python @flow`    | N/A             |
    | `#!Python @subflow` | N/A             |

    </center>

    !!! Warning

        Due to the difference in how Jobflow handles workflows compared to other supported workflow engines, any quacc recipes that have been pre-defined with a `#!Python @flow` or `#!Python @subflow` decorator (i.e. have `_flow` in the name) cannot be run directly with Jobflow.

The quacc descriptors are drop-in replacements for the specified workflow engine analogue, which we will use for the remainder of the tutorials. Based on the value for the `WORKFLOW_ENGINE` global variable in your [quacc settings](../settings/settings.md), the appropriate decorator will be automatically selected. If the `WORKFLOW_ENGINE` setting is set to `None`, the decorators will have no effect on the underlying function.

## Simple Workflow

Let's do the following:

1. Add two numbers (e.g. `#!Python 1 + 2`)
2. Multiply the output of Step 1 by a third number (e.g. `#!Python 3 * 3`)

In practice, we would want each of the two tasks to be their own compute job.

  A[Input] --> B(add) --> C(mult) --> D[Output];
```

=== "Parsl"

    !!! Important

        If you haven't done so yet, make sure you update the quacc `WORKFLOW_ENGINE` [configuration variable](../settings/settings.md) and load the default Parsl configuration:

        ```bash
        quacc set WORKFLOW_ENGINE parsl
        ```

        ```python title="python"
        import parsl

        parsl.load()  #  (1)!
        ```

        1. It is necessary to instantiate a Parsl configuration before running Parsl workflows. This command loads the default (local) configuration and only needs to be done once.

    ```python
    from quacc import job


    @job  #  (1)!
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b


    @job
    def mult(a, b):
        return a * b


    def workflow(a, b, c):  #  (2)!
        return mult(add(a, b), c)


    future = workflow(1, 2, 3)  #  (3)!
    result = future.result()  #  (4)!
    print(result)  # 9
    ```

    1. The `#!Python @job` decorator will be transformed into `#!Python @python_app`.

    2. The `#!Python @flow` decorator doesn't actually do anything when using Parsl, so we chose to not include it here for brevity.

    3. This will create a `PythonApp` object that represents the workflow. At this point, the workflow has been dispatched, but only a reference is returned.

    4. Calling `.result()` will block until the workflow is complete and return the result.

=== "Covalent"

    !!! Important

        If you haven't done so yet, make sure you update the quacc `WORKFLOW_ENGINE` [configuration variable](../settings/settings.md) and start the Covalent server:

        ```bash
        quacc set WORKFLOW_ENGINE covalent
        covalent start
        ```

    ```python
    import covalent as ct
    from quacc import flow, job


    @job  #  (1)!
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b


    @job
    def mult(a, b):
        return a * b


    @flow  #  (2)!
    def workflow(a, b, c):
        return mult(add(a, b), c)


    dispatch_id = ct.dispatch(workflow)(1, 2, 3)   #  (3)!
    result = ct.get_result(dispatch_id, wait=True)  #  (4)!
    print(result)  # 9
    ```

    1. The `#!Python @job` decorator will be transformed into `#!Python @ct.electron`.

    2. The `#!Python @flow` decorator will be transformed into `#!Python @ct.lattice`.

    3. This command will dispatch the workflow to the Covalent server, and a unique dispatch ID will be returned in place of the result.

    4. This command will fetch the result from the Covalent server. The `wait=True` argument will block until the workflow is complete.

=== "Dask"

    !!! Important

        If you haven't done so yet, make sure you update the quacc `WORKFLOW_ENGINE` [configuration variable](../settings/settings.md) and load the default Dask client:

        ```bash
        quacc set WORKFLOW_ENGINE dask
        ```

        ```python title="python"
        from dask.distributed import Client

        client = Client()  #  (1)!
        ```

        1. It is necessary to instantiate a Dask client before running Dask workflows. This command loads the default (local) client and only needs to be done once.

    ```python
    from quacc import job


    @job  #  (1)!
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b


    @job
    def mult(a, b):
        return a * b


    def workflow(a, b, c):  #  (2)!
        return mult(add(a, b), c)


    delayed = workflow(1, 2, 3)  #  (3)!
    result = client.compute(delayed).result()  #  (4)!
    print(result)  # 9
    ```

    1. The `#!Python @job` decorator will be transformed into `#!Python @delayed`.

    2. The `#!Python @flow` decorator doesn't actually do anything when using Dask, so we chose to not include it here for brevity.

    3. This returns a `Delayed` object. A reference is returned.

    4. There are multiple ways to resolve a `Delayed` object. Here, `#!Python client.compute(delayed)` will return a `Future` object, which can be resolved with `.result()`. The `.result()` call will block until the workflow is complete and return the result. As an alternative, you could also use `#!Python delayed.compute()` to dispatch and resolve the `Delayed` object in one command. Similarly, you could use `#!Python dask.compute(delayed)[0]`, where the `[0]` indexing is needed because `#!Python dask.compute()` alwaays returns a tuple.

=== "Redun"

    !!! Important

        If you haven't done so yet, make sure you update the quacc `WORKFLOW_ENGINE` [configuration variable](../settings/settings.md):

        ```bash
        quacc set WORKFLOW_ENGINE redun
        ```

        ```python title="python"
        from redun import Scheduler

        scheduler = Scheduler()  #  (1)!
        ```

        1. It is necessary to instantiate the scheduler before submitting calculations.

    ```python
    from quacc import flow, job

    @job  #  (1)!
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b


    @job
    def mult(a, b):
        return a * b


    @flow  #  (2)!
    def workflow(a, b, c):
        return mult(add(a, b), c)


    result = scheduler.run(workflow(1, 2, 3))  # (3)!
    print(result)  # 9
    ```

    1. The `#!Python @job` decorator will be transformed into a Redun `#!Python @task`.

    2. The `#!Python @flow` decorator will also be transformed into a Redun `#!Python @task`. Everything in Redun is a `#!Python @task`, so it doesn't matter what quacc decorator you apply. We chose `#!Python @flow` simply for clarity.

    3. This command will submit the workflow to the Redun scheduler.

=== "Jobflow"

    !!! Important

        If you haven't done so yet, make sure you update the quacc `WORKFLOW_ENGINE` [configuration variable](../settings/settings.md):

        ```bash
        quacc set WORKFLOW_ENGINE jobflow
        ```

    ```python
    import jobflow as jf
    from quacc import job


    @job  #  (1)!
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b


    @job
    def mult(a, b):
        return a * b


    job1 = add(1, 2)
    job2 = mult(job1.output, 3)
    flow = jf.Flow([job1, job2])  #  (2)!

    responses = jf.run_locally(flow)  #  (3)!
    result = responses[job2.uuid][1].output   #  (4)!
    print(result)  # 9
    ```

    1. The `#!Python @job` decorator will be transformed into `#!Python @jf.job`.

    2. A `#!Python @jf.Flow` object is created to represent the workflow.

    3. The workflow is run locally and the result is returned in a dictionary.

    4. The result is extracted from the dictionary by using the UUID of the second job in the workflow.

## Stripping the Decorator from a Job

If you ever want to strip the decorator from a pre-decorated `#!Python @job` for any reason, you can call the `.__wrapped__` attribute. This returns the original function.

```python
from quacc import job


@job
def add(a, b):
    return a + b


add.__wrapped__(1, 2)  # 3
```
