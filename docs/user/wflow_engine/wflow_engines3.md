# Modifying Decorators

Occasionally, you may want to modify the decorators of select jobs in a workflow, such as to modify the executor of a given function. This can be done in an analogous way as in the [Modifying Recipes](../recipes/modifications.md) section except here we use the `decorators` keyword argument instead of the `parameters` keyword argument.

## Modifying a Job in a Dynamic Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Input] --> B(Make Slabs)
  B --> C(Slab Relax) --> G(Slab Static) --> K[Output]
  B --> D(Slab Relax) --> H(Slab Static) --> K[Output]
  B --> E(Slab Relax) --> I(Slab Static) --> K[Output]
  B --> F(Slab Relax) --> J(Slab Static) --> K[Output];
```

In this example, we will run a pre-made workflow that generates a set of slabs from a bulk structure and then runs a structure relaxation and static calculation on each slab. We will specifically highlight an example where we want to modify the applied decorator of only the static calculation.

```python
from ase.build import bulk
from quacc import job
from quacc.recipes.emt.core import relax_job
from quacc.recipes.emt.slabs import bulk_to_slabs_flow

# Define the Atoms object
atoms = bulk("Cu")

# Define the workflow
result = bulk_to_slabs_flow(
    atoms, decorators={"static_job": job(foo=bar)}  # (1)!
)

# Print the result
print(result)
```
