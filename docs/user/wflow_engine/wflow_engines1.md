# Pre-Defined Recipes

Here, we will show how to use quacc with one of a variety of workflow engines to construct, dispatch, and monitor your calculations.

In quacc, there are two types of recipes:

1. Individual compute jobs with the suffix `_job` that have been pre-defined with a `#!Python @job` decorator.
2. Multi-step workflows with the suffix `_flow` that have been pre-defined with a `#!Python @flow` decorator.

## Running a Pre-Defined Job

We will now try running a pre-defined job where we relax a bulk Cu structure using EMT, which is pre-defined in quacc as [`quacc.recipes.emt.core.relax_job`](https://quantum-accelerators.github.io/quacc/reference/quacc/recipes/emt/core.html#quacc.recipes.emt.core.relax_job).

  A[Input] --> B(Relax) --> C[Output];
```

=== "Covalent"

    !!! Important

        If you haven't done so yet, make sure you started the Covalent server with `covalent start` in the command-line.

    ```python
    import covalent as ct
    from ase.build import bulk
    from quacc import flow
    from quacc.recipes.emt.core import relax_job

    # Define the workflow
    workflow = flow(relax_job)  # (1)!

    # Make an Atoms object of a bulk Cu structure
    atoms = bulk("Cu")

    # Dispatch the workflow to the Covalent server
    # with the bulk Cu Atoms object as the input
    dispatch_id = ct.dispatch(workflow)(atoms)  # (2)!

    # Fetch the result from the server
    result = ct.get_result(dispatch_id, wait=True)  # (3)!
    print(result)
    ```

    1. This is shorthand for the following:

        ```python
        @flow
        def workflow(atoms):
            return relax_job(atoms)
        ```

        Also note that the `relax_job` function was pre-defined in quacc with a `#!Python @job` decorator, which is why did not need to include it here.

    2. Because the workflow is only sent to the server with `ct.dispatch`, calling `workflow(atoms)` would run the workflow as a normal function without Covalent having any role.

    3. You don't need to set `wait=True` in practice. Once you call `ct.dispatch`, the workflow will begin running. The `ct.get_result` function is used to fetch the workflow status and results from the server.

    !!! Tip

        Covalent has several [configuration parameters](https://docs.covalent.xyz/docs/user-documentation/how-to/customization/) of its own that can influence runtime behavior. For instance, the `opt.traj` file containing the optimization trajectory that was written out by `relax_job` will be stored in Covalent's `workdir` location: `#!Python ct.get_config()["executors"]["dask"]["workdir"]`.

=== "Parsl"

    !!! Important

        If you haven't done so yet, make sure you have loaded a Parsl configuration in your Python script. An example for running on your local machine is included below.

        ```python
        import parsl

        parsl.load()
        ```

        Also make sure you have specified `"parsl"` as the `WORKFLOW_ENGINE` in your [quacc settings](../settings.md).

    ```python
    from ase.build import bulk
    from quacc.recipes.emt.core import relax_job

    # Make an Atoms object of a bulk Cu structure
    atoms = bulk("Cu")

    # Call the PythonApp
    future = relax_job(atoms)  # (1)!

    # Print result
    print(future.result())  # (2)!
    ```

    1. The `relax_job` function was pre-defined in quacc with a `#!Python @job` decorator, which is why did not need to include it here. We also did not need to use a `#!Python @flow` decorator because Parsl does not have an analogous decorator.

    2. The use of `.result()` serves to block any further calculations from running until it is resolved. Calling `.result()` also returns the function output as opposed to the `AppFuture` object.

=== "Jobflow"

    !!! Important

        Make sure you have specified `"jobflow"` as the `WORKFLOW_ENGINE` in your [quacc settings](../settings.md).

    ```python
    import jobflow as jf
    from ase.build import bulk
    from quacc.recipes.emt.core import relax_job

    # Make an Atoms object of a bulk Cu structure
    atoms = bulk("Cu")

    # Define the Job
    job = relax_job(atoms)  # (1)!

    # Run the job locally
    responses = jf.run_locally(job, create_folders=True)  # (2)!

    # Get the result
    result = responses[job.uuid][1].output
    print(result)
    ```

    1. The `relax_job` function was pre-defined in quacc with a `#!Python @job` decorator, which is why did not need to include it here.

    2. We chose to run the job locally, but other workflow managers supported by Jobflow can be imported and used.

## Running a Pre-Defined Workflow

We will now try running a pre-defined workflow where we carve all possible slabs from a given structure, run a new relaxation calculation on each slab, and then a static calculation for each relaxed slab. This is implemented in [`quacc.recipes.emt.slabs.bulk_to_slabs_flow`](https://quantum-accelerators.github.io/quacc/reference/quacc/recipes/emt/slabs.html#quacc.recipes.emt.slabs.bulk_to_slabs_flow).

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Input] --> B(Make Slabs)
  B --> C(Slab Relax) --> G(Slab Static) --> K[Output]
  B --> D(Slab Relax) --> H(Slab Static) --> K[Output]
  B --> E(Slab Relax) --> I(Slab Static) --> K[Output]
  B --> F(Slab Relax) --> J(Slab Static) --> K[Output];
```

=== "Covalent"

    ```python
    import covalent as ct
    from ase.build import bulk
    from quacc.recipes.emt.slabs import bulk_to_slabs_flow

    atoms = bulk("Cu")
    dispatch_id = ct.dispatch(bulk_to_slabs_flow)(atoms)  # (1)!
    result = ct.get_result(dispatch_id, wait=True)
    print(result)
    ```

    1. We didn't need to wrap `bulk_to_slabs_flow` with a decorator because it is already pre-decorated with a `@flow` decorator.

=== "Parsl"

    ```python
    from ase.build import bulk
    from quacc.recipes.emt.slabs import bulk_to_slabs_flow

    # Define the Atoms object
    atoms = bulk("Cu")

    # Define the workflow
    future = bulk_to_slabs_flow(atoms)  # (1)!

    # Print the results
    print(future.result())
    ```

    1. We didn't need to wrap `bulk_to_slabs_flow` with a decorator because it is already pre-decorated with a `@flow` decorator.

=== "Jobflow"

    Due to the difference in how Jobflow handles dynamic workflows compared to Covalent and Parsl, any quacc recipes that have been pre-defined with a `#!Python @flow` decorator (i.e. those with `_flow` in the name) cannot be used with Jobflow directly.

    That said, quacc fully supports custom Jobflow-based workflows to resolve this limitation. For example, instead of using [`.emt.slabs.bulk_to_slabs_flow`](https://quantum-accelerators.github.io/quacc/reference/quacc/recipes/emt/slabs.html#quacc.recipes.emt.slabs.bulk_to_slabs_flow), this workflow can be equivalently run as follows using the Jobflow-specific [`.emt._jobflow.slabs.bulk_to_slabs_flow`](https://quantum-accelerators.github.io/quacc/reference/quacc/recipes/emt/_jobflow/slabs.html#quacc.recipes.emt._jobflow.slabs.bulk_to_slabs_flow) function.

    ```python
    import jobflow as jf
    from ase.build import bulk
    from quacc.recipes.emt._jobflow.slabs import bulk_to_slabs_flow

    # Define the Atoms object
    atoms = bulk("Cu")

    # Construct the Flow
    flow = bulk_to_slabs_flow(atoms)

    # Run the workflow locally
    jf.run_locally(flow, create_folders=True)
    ```

    In the case of the Jobflow-specific `bulk_to_slabs_flow`, it returns a [`Response(replace)`](<https://materialsproject.github.io/jobflow/tutorials/5-dynamic-flows.html#The-Response(replace)-option>) object that dynamically replaces the `Flow` with several downstream jobs.
