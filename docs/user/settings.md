# Quacc Settings

## Modifying Quacc Settings

By default, the global quacc settings can be found in the [`settings.py`](https://github.com/quantum-accelerators/quacc/blob/main/src/quacc/settings.py) file. If you wish to modify any of the global quacc settings, there are two ways to do so.

### Using a YAML File

The easiest way is to create a custom YAML file with custom settings. For instance, it might look something like the following if you wanted to modify the `SCRATCH_DIR` and `GZIP_FILES` settings.

```yaml title="quacc.yaml"
SCRATCH_DIR: /tmp
GZIP_FILES: false
```

By default, quacc looks for this YAML file at `~/quacc.yaml`. If you wish to store the `quacc.yaml` file somewhere else, you can define the environment variable `QUACC_CONFIG_FILE` and point it to the `quacc.yaml` path of your choosing.

### Using Environment Variables

If you want to define quacc settings on-the-fly without writing them to a YAML file, you can instead modify the desired settings by defining individual environment variables with `QUACC` as the prefix. For instance, to modify the `SCRATCH_DIR` setting to be `/tmp`, simply define `QUACC_SCRATCH_DIR=/tmp` as a new environment variable.
