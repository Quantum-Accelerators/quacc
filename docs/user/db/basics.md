# Setup and Storing Results

Here, we describe how to set up quacc with a database of your choosing.

=== "General Purpose"

    For a given recipe, you can have quacc automatically store the final output summaries in your desired database by defining a [Maggma data store](https://materialsproject.github.io/maggma/reference/stores/) in the `PRIMARY_STORE` [quacc setting](../settings/settings.md).

    For instance, let's pretend you have decided to make a [`MongoStore`](https://materialsproject.github.io/maggma/reference/stores/#maggma.stores.mongolike.MongoStore) be your database of choice. After defining or loading your Maggma store, you would call `.to_json()` to get a dictionary representation. You can then store this JSON, formatted as a string, in the `PRIMARY_STORE` global quacc setting.

    ```python
    from maggma.stores import MongoStore

    store = MongoStore(
        "my_db_name",
        "my_collection_name",
        username="my_username",
        password="my_password",
        host="localhost",
        port=27017,
    )
    print(store.to_json())  # This is the JSON string you would store in PRIMARY_STORE
    ```

    ```yaml title="~/.quacc.yaml"
    PRIMARY_STORE: '{"@module": "maggma.stores.mongolike", "@class": "MongoStore", "@version": "0.51.19", "database": "my_db_name", "collection_name": "my_collection_name", "host": "localhost", "port": 27017, "username": "my_username", "password": "my_password", "ssh_tunnel": null, "safe_update": false, "auth_source": "my_db_name", "mongoclient_kwargs": {}, "default_sort": null}'
    ```

    ??? "How to Manually Upload to a Data Store"

        If you would prefer to store results in your database manually (perhaps because you are limited in terms of how much data you can store), you can use the [quacc.wflow_tools.db.results_to_db][] function, as shown in the example below.

        ```python
        from maggma.stores import MongoStore
        from quacc.wflow_tools.db import results_to_db

        # Let `results` be an output (or list of outputs) from quacc recipes

        # Define your database details
        store = MongoStore(
            "my_db_name",
            "my_collection_name",
            username="my_username",
            password="my_password",
            host="localhost",
            port=27017,
        )

        # Store the results
        results_to_db(store, results)
        ```

=== "Covalent"

    Covalent automatically stores all the inputs and outputs in an SQLite database, which you can find at the `"db_path"` when you run `covalent config`, and the results can be queried using the `#!Python ct.get_result(<dispatch ID>)` syntax.

=== "Prefect"

    To use a database with Prefect, read the [Database](https://docs.prefect.io/2.10.2/concepts/database/) section of the Prefect documentation as well as how to [persist results](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/results/#persisting-results).

=== "Jobflow"

    If you are using Jobflow to construct your workflows, it will automatically store the results in the database you defined during the [setup process](../../install/wflow_engines.md). No additional steps are needed.
