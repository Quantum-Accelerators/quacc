# Writing Flows

## Simple Flows

### Overview

A flow is a Python function decorated by `#!Python @flow` that contains a collection of jobs. Refer to the [Workflow Syntax](../../user/basics/wflow_syntax.md) page for more information on the syntax of flows.

!!! Important "The Most Important Rules of Flows"

    The flow itself does not contain computationally intensive tasks. It simply calls other jobs (and/or flows) and defines the workflow logic. In general, essentially no operations can be done on the outputs of a job in a flow; they can only be passed as inputs to other jobs. This is because the output is a _future_ whose value is not resolved until runtime. Note that doing `result["atoms"]`, where `result` is the output of a job in the flow, returns a _future_ and not the actual `Atoms` object. When passed as an input to a subsequent job, however, it will know to automatically resolve the `Atoms` object before running.

### Production Example

A simple, representative flow can be found in [quacc.recipes.vasp.mp24.mp_metagga_relax_flow][].

!!! Note

    All `#!Python @flow`-decorated functions distributed with quacc must allow for the individual job parameters and decorators to be updated by the user, which is typically done via the [quacc.wflow_tools.customizers.customize_funcs][] function. Refer to the example above for details.

## Dynamic Flows

quacc fully supports complex, dynamic flows where the number of jobs is not known _a priori_. In this case, a common pattern is the use of a subflow, defined with a `#!Python @subflow` decorator. A subflow is just like a flow, except the returned object is a list of job outputs.

!!! Note "Minimal Example"

    Let's do the following:

    1. Add two numbers (e.g. `#!Python 1 + 2`)
    2. Make a list of random length of the output of Step 1 (e.g. `#!Python [3, 3, 3]`)
    3. Add a third number to each element of the list from Step 2 (e.g. `#!Python [3 + 3, 3 + 3, 3 + 3]`)

    In practice, we would want each of the two tasks to be their own compute job.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    A[Input] --> B(add) --> C(make list)
    C(make list) --> D(add) --> G[Output]
    C(make list) --> E(add) --> G[Output]
    C(make list) --> F(add) --> G[Output]
    ```

    ```python
    from random import randint
    from quacc import flow, job, subflow


    @job
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b


    @job
    def make_list(val):
        return [val] * randint(2, 5)


    @subflow
    def add_distributed(vals, c):
        outputs = []
        for val in vals:
            output = add(val, c)
            outputs.append(output)
        return outputs


    @flow
    def workflow(a, b, c):
        output1 = add(a, b)
        output2 = make_list(output1)
        output3 = add_distributed(output2, c)
        return output3
    ```

### Production Example

A representative example of a complex flow can be found in [quacc.recipes.emt.slabs.bulk_to_slabs_flow][].

This flow is "dynamic" because the number of slabs is not known until the pre-requisite relaxation step is completed.

!!! Note

    To prevent code duplication, we put common recipes that are code-agnostic in `quacc.recipes.common`. These recipes are not meant to be run directly, but rather called by other recipes.

    For instance, [quacc.recipes.emt.slabs.bulk_to_slabs_flow][] and [quacc.recipes.vasp.slabs.bulk_to_slabs_flow][] both call the same [quacc.recipes.common.slabs.bulk_to_slabs_subflow][].
