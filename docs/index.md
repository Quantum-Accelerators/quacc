`quacc` (pronounced "quack" ðŸ¦†) is a flexible platform for high-throughput computational materials science and quantum chemistry built for the exascale era, maintained by the [Rosen Research Group](https://rosen.cbe.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University.

- `quacc` makes it possible to easily write complex workflows that can be run anywhere, anyhow. By anywhere, we mean locally, HPC, the cloud, or any combination thereof. By anyhow, we mean via one of several modern workflow management solutions

- `quacc` leverages community resources. It is built around the [Atomic Simulation Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) and much of the software infrastructure powering the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org).

- `quacc` gives you the freedom of choice. Through a single, unified interface to several [supported workflow management solutions](https://quantum-accelerators.github.io/quacc/user/basics/wflow_overview.html), `quacc` lets you use what best suits your unique computing needs.

- `quacc` has [pre-made recipes](https://quantum-accelerators.github.io/quacc/user/recipes/recipes_list.html) for the following packages: DFTB+, Gaussian, GULP, NewtonNet, ORCA, Psi4, Q-Chem, tblite, and VASP. It's simple to add your favorite!
