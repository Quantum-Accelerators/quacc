- A function `quacc.util.db.covalent_to_db` to store Covalent results in a database.
- A new `pop_analysis` kwarg to `quacc.schemas.cclib.summarize_run`

### Changed

- Individual compute jobs are now functions instead of classes.
- All compute jobs are wrapped by `@ct.electron` instead of `@job`.
- Use of Jobflow is now optional.
- Use of a MongoDB is now optional.
- Changed the `extras` names in `setup.py`.
- Updated the dependencies.
- Increased default for `max_steps` in `run_ase_opt` from 100 to 500.
- Switch license to standard BSD-3.
- Simplified output schema for VASP slab workflows.
- Changed `removed_empties` default to `False` for the VASP schema.
- Use `setups_pbe54_MP` as the default pseudopotentials for the `BulkSet` preset in VASP.
- Modified thermo and vibrational frequency schemas.
- The `run_ase_opt` function returns an ASE `Optimizer` object instead of a `Trajectory` object.
- The `summarize_opt_run` function takes in an ASE `Optimizer` object instead of a `Trajectory` object.
- The `summarize_opt_run` function no longer needs the `atoms.calc.parameters` kwarg.
- Renamed `prerelax` kwarg in `qmof_relax_job` was changed to `run_prerelax` to reflect that it is a boolean.
- Renamed `volume_relax` kwarg in VASP recipes to `relax_volume` to reflect that it is a boolean.
- Renamed `molden` to `write_molden` in Gaussian recipes to reflect that it is a boolean.
- Renamed `quacc.recipes.tblite.core.thermo_job` to `quacc.recipes.tblite.core.freq_job`.
- Renamed `quacc.schemas.calc` to `quacc.schemas.ase`.
- Renamed `thermo_job` to `freq_job`.
- Split `quacc.util.basics` and its associated functions into `quacc.util.dicts` and `quacc.util.files`.
- Moved `main` branch to an orphan and started new `main` branch.
- Moved ideal gas thermo calculation to `quacc.util.thermo`.
- Moved `check_logfile` to `quacc.util.files`.
- Moved `convert_auto_kpts` to `quacc.calculators.vasp`.

### Fixed

- If the user-specified `scratch_dir` does not exist on the filesystem when using `run_calc`, `run_ase_opt`, or `run_ase_vib`, it will be created.
- Fixed issue in the `TBLite` `ThermoJob` where magnetic moments were not being passed between the `Vibrations` and `IdealGasThermo` jobs.
- Fixed type hinting.

### Removed

- Removed the `xtb` recipes in favor of the `tblite` recipes following deprecation warning.
- Removed the `requirements.txt` file in favor of the `setup.py` file.
