## [UNRELEASED]

### Added

- Added this `CHANGELOG.md` file.
- Added the `quacc.recipes.emt.parsl` module.
- Added a CLI for `quacc` along with a `quacc config` option to configure Covalent appropriately upon install.
- Added a `quacc.util.wflows.make_dask_cluster` function to easily generate a Dask cluster.

### Changed

- The `slab_relax_job` kwarg in `recipes.emt.slabs` and `recipes.vasp.slabs` workflows can no longer be set to `None`, as there are few situations where this would be desired.
- Class-based recipes have been converted to functions since they don't save state or have inheritance.

### Docs

- Expanded upon Parsl documentation.
- Added docs for Prefect.
- Modified tutorials and added example configs for Slurm.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where parallel, multithreaded Python jobs could cause file I/O issues.

### Removed

- Removed `quacc.recipes.vasp.jobflow` module to prioritize Covalent and Parsl.
