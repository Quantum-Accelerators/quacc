# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project generally adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0]

### Added

- A `GenericRunner` to run arbitrary commands
- D3(BJ) parameters for HSE06 in the `Vasp` calculator

### Changed

- The default `BulkSet.yaml` will be removed and replaced with `DefaultSetPBE.yaml`. The two are extremely similar. Updates include: ALGO = Fast --> ALGO = Normal, GGA_COMPAT = False, and changing the default Yb and Eu pseudopotentials from _2 to _3.
- The `SlabSet.yaml` will be removed and replaced with `SlabSetPBE.yaml` to ensure internal consistency with the base `DefaultSetPBE.yaml`.
- The `VASP_PRESET_MAG_DEFAULT` setting has been changed from a default of 1.0 to 0.5 to prevent accidental convergence to erroneous radical states, particularly in molecular systems.
- The Materials Project recipes were updated to match the newer MP24 settings

## [0.17.1]

### Changed

- Makes ASE 3.26.0 the minimum supporte version

## [0.17.0]

### Added

- Added `RosenFastSetPBE.yaml`, `RosenFastSetR2SCAN.yaml`, and `setups_rosen.yaml`
- The user will now be warned if they are likely to have Pulay stresses due to the use of `Li_sv` and `ENCUT` < 650

### Changed

- Renamed `magmoms_base.yaml` to `magmoms_high.yaml`
- Merged the identical `setups_54.yaml` and `setups_64.yaml` files into a single `setups_recommended.yaml`
- The RosenSets will now use `Eu_3` and `Yb_3` instead of `Eu_2` and `Yb_2`

## [0.16.0]

### Added

- Added support for TensorNet

### Changed

- Default MLP calculators have been updated across the board: M3GNET and CHGNet now default to the MatPES PBE models, CHGNet relies on matgl, and mace-mp-0 has been renamed mace-mp to get the default model.

## [0.15.5]

### Changed

- Simplified FAIRChem MLP usage

## [0.15.4]

### Changed

- `RosenPBESet.yaml` now uses ALGO = "All" instead of "Fast"

## [0.15.3]

### Added

- Updated FAIRChem models to support UMA and redesigned FAIRChem repo

## [0.15.2]

### Fixed

- Allow for `kpts=None` with VASP auto-swaps

## [0.15.1]

### Added

- Added `RosenSetPBE.yaml` and `RosenSetR2CAN.yaml` for recommended VASP parameters that Rosen likes to use.

### Changed

- No longer automatically sets `NPAR = 1` when `LELF = True` due to convergence issues that can arise.

## [0.15.0]

### Fixed

- Various dependency fixes

## [0.14.0]

### Fixed

- Force `relax_cell=False` for elastic calculations

### Removed

- There is no more `quacc_results.json.gz` file written out to disk. This turned out to be way more trouble than it was worth, over-complicating recipes by requiring the use of schemas with knowledge of the current working directory at all times.
- There is no more `STORE` quacc setting. Storing in databases will require calling the `results_to_db` function or using a workflow engine (e.g. Jobflow, FireWorks, Prefect, Covalent).

## [0.13.0]

### Added

- New elastic workflows for MLIPs and EMT

### Changed

- The existing elastic workflow has been completely overhauled so that it is more practical t ouse
- The results dictionary returned at the end of the run has been modified, such that the structure metadata is now put under the `structure_metadata` key rather than the root level of the dictionary. Should this breaking change prove undesirable by the community, it can be reverted.

### Fixed

- Fixed various type hints

- Support for MD workflows

### Fixed

- Fixed an edge-case that can occur in multithreading environments where in-memory changes to the `QuaccSettings` could carry over to a concurrent thread
- Made the detection of intermediate step directories more robust

### Removed

- The global `SETTINGS` variable is gone! Modifying a global variable can cause havoc in multithreaded environments and was never compatible with workflow engines. Refer to the [Modifying Settings](https://quantum-accelerators.github.io/quacc/user/settings/settings.html) page for the recommended approach. For most users without an active workflow engine, this will be the `with change_settings()` context manager.

## [0.9.5]

### Changed

- Pinned numpy version to < 2.0 (for now...)

## [0.9.4]

### Added

- VASP: Added a new logging statement to specifically highlight which parameters were swapped, not just which recommendations were made

- The output schema is now written to a serialized JSON file instead of pickle for security and ease-of-use reasons. It can be rehydrated via `loadfn("quacc_results.json.gz")` where `loadfn` is from `monty.serialization import loadfn`
- The `fmax` attribute was moved from the base level to the `parameters_opt` section since it is an input parameter

### Fixed

### Fixed

- Increased support of `~/` throughout quacc file handling mechanisms
- Fixed an infinite recursion error when `copy_decompress_files_from_dir` was run in the current working directory.

## [0.4.6]

### Added

- The `WORKFLOW_ENGINE` quacc setting now accepts `None`.
- A `DEBUG` quacc setting as been added.

### Changed

- The way to run complex, dynamic flows has been modified to rely on `functools.partial()` instead of kwargs. See the updated documentation.
- Refactored test suite

## [0.4.5]

## [0.4.3]

### Added

- Added preliminary support for the `Dask` workflow engine via Dask Delayed and Dask Distributed.

### Changed

- Renamed `CREATE_UNIQUE_WORKDIR` to `CREATE_UNIQUE_DIR` to better reflect its utility.
- The default for the `SCRATCH_DIR` setting is now `None` instead of `~/.quacc_scratch`. In other words, the default is to not use a scratch directory. This should help with onboarding, and the ability to set it as `None` may be broadly of interest. Setting the `SCRATCH_DIR` to a given `Path` will still work as expected.
- Files are no longer recursively _copied_ from `SCRATCH_DIR` to `RESULTS_DIR`. Instead, they are recursively moved. This should speed up I/O operations.

### Fixed

- Fixed a missing `phonopy_kwargs` keyword argument in `quacc.recipes.common.phonons`

- Added phonopy schema in `quacc.schemas.phonons`
- Added EMT phonon workflow

### Changed

- The method for specifying swaps to the default calculator arguments in recipes has been overhauled. In place of the previous `calc_swaps: dict` approach, additional parameters can be specified via the `**kwargs`. In practice, this means in recipes you can do `scf = "diis", max_steps=100` instead of `calc_swaps={"scf":"diis", "max_steps":100}`, for instance.
- Moved `quacc.runners.calc` to `quacc.runners.ase`
- Moved `quacc.runners.prep` to `quacc.schemas.prep`

## [0.2.8]

### Changed

- Decorators are now applied at import time rather than at function-call time.

### Fixed

- Fixed compatibility with FireWorks.
- Fixed I/O issue on Windows and NFS file systems where Sella optimizations would crash.

## [0.2.7]

### Added

- Added a `freq_job` recipe in Q-Chem (@samblau)
- Added support for TRICs in Sella calculations (@samblau)

### Changed

- Refactored all recipes to prevent code duplication
- Set `LREAL = False` in VASP `BulkSet.yaml`

## [0.2.6]

### Added

- Add support for `Path` objects everywhere possible.

### Changed

- Charge and spin multiplicity are now required arguments in molecular DFT calculators.
- Slab recipes now use `make_slabs_from_bulk` instead of `make_max_slabs_from_bulk`
- Use the `logging` module when warnings do not need to be immediately addressed.
- Functions are no longer used as kwargs in recipes to help with (de)serialization in certain workflow engines.

### Removed

- Removed `make_max_slabs_from_bulk` function.

## [0.2.5]

### Added

- Added support for the Redun workflow engine.
- Added a simple CLI for (un)setting YAML config parameters.

## [0.2.4]

### Changed

- Updated VASP co-pilot rules and `BulkSet.yaml` in accordance with recent MP benchmarking (#849).
- Moved `fetch_atoms` to `quacc.schemas`.

### Fixed

- VASP: Fixed a scenario where SIGMA was set to 0.05 if the user provided SIGMA > 0.05. This was supposed to happen when ISMEAR = 0 but was previously done when ISMEAR = -5, which is not influenced by SIGMA.
- Fixed `mp_metagga_relax_flow` to use a `#!Python @flow` decorator instead of `#!Python @job`
- Fixed the Q-Chem Quasi-IRC job to run as one `#!Python @job` instead of two.

- Added new defect utilities (@rwexler)
- Added a custom Q-Chem calculator based on Pymatgen and Custodian. (@samblau)
- Added Q-chem core recipes. (@samblau)
- Added the ability to pass option `run_kwargs` to the `.run()` method of the ASE optimizers.

- Refactored and standardized the NewtonNet recipes to match the other recipes

### Fixed

- The `WORKFLOW_ENGINE` setting can now be set dynamically, as expected.

## [0.2.2]

### Changed

- Changed package handling in `pyproject.toml` to better handle pip installs.

## [0.2.1]

### Added

- Added NewtonNet recipes and better sella support (@kumaranu)

### Changed

- Standardized `relax_cell` to be `False` by default for all recipes.
- Update the default `SIGMA` and `ISMEAR` in `MPScanSet` to match the new values to be used in Atomate2.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug on Windows where the trajectory file would not be closed after a relaxation, causing permission errors.

### Removed

- Removed atomate2 as a dependency.
- Removed experimental Prefect support.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Added a quacc global setting, `WORKFLOW_ENGINE`, to set the workflow manager.
- Added support for the new `covalent-hpc-plugin` in `pyproject.toml`.

### Changed

- Quacc recipes are now decorated with generic `#!Python @job`, `#!Python @subflow`, or `#!Python @flow` decorators to be workflow engine-agnostic.
- Covalent is now an optional dependency to allow the base `quacc` package to be dependency-light.
- Default VASP pseudopotentials changed to `setups_pbe54.yaml`.
- Changed `quacc.recipes.emt.jobflow` and `quacc.recipes.emt.prefect` to `quacc.recipes.emt._jobflow` and `quacc.recipes.emt._prefect`

### Fixed

- Set `LMAXMIX` based on the `Z` value, not the s/p/d/f-block type.
- Do not set automatically `LMAXTAU` to 8 for f-containing elements in `Vasp` calculator.

- Removed `quacc config` command-line option.

## [0.1.3]

### Added

- Added a `PRIMARY_STORE` quacc setting that, when specified, will automatically store all results in the specified Maggma store.

### Changed

- The trajectory is now stored in `quacc.schemas.cclib.summarize_run`.
- By default, results are now stored in a fixed `RESULTS_DIR`, which defaults to the current working directory.

### Fixed

- Fix path-related issues when running in local multi-threaded mode.
- Psi4 recipes now use `uks` for unrestricted calculations instead of `uhf`.

## [0.1.2]

### Added

- Added support for Prefect.
- Added `quacc.wflow_tools` module.

### Changed

- Made slab-related kwargs more consistent, such as by changing `slab_relax_electron`/`slab_relax_app` to just `slab_relax` regardless of workflow manager.

## [0.1.1]

### Added

- Added this `CHANGELOG.md` file.
- Added the `quacc.recipes.emt.parsl` module.
- Added a CLI for `quacc` along with a `quacc config` option to configure Covalent appropriately upon install.
- Added generic type hints for schemas.
- Added a `CREATE_UNIQUE_DIR` global setting to have quacc automatically make a unique working directory for each calculation.
- Added `CHECK_CONVERGENCE` to global settings.

### Changed

- The `quacc` directory is now found in a `src` basefolder.
- All recipes now support the `Atoms` object being passed in as an `AtomsSchema`.
- The `slab_relax_job` kwarg in `recipes.emt.slabs` and `recipes.vasp.slabs` workflows can no longer be set to `None`, as there are few situations where this would be desired.
- Class-based recipes have been converted to functions since they don't save state or have inheritance.

### Docs

- Switched the docs from Furo to Material for MkDocs.
- Expanded upon Parsl documentation.
- Modified tutorials and added example configs for Slurm.

### Fixed

- Temporary directories are cleaned up after the run is completed.
