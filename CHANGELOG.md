# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- Created a `quacc.wflow_tools.customizers` module to aid in customizing pre-made recipes.

### Changed

- Overhauled how sub-jobs in recipes can be dynamically modified by the user to increase flexibility.
- Changed default `fmax` for `quacc.recipes.mlp.core.relax_job` to 0.05.
- Renamed the `quacc.utils.dicts.merge_dicts` function to `._recursive_dict_pair_merge` to better reflect its functionality.
- Renamed the `quacc.utils.dicts.merge_several_dicts` function to `.recursive_dict_merge` to better reflect its functionality.

### Fixed

- Increased support of `~/` throughout quacc file handling mechanisms
- Fixed an infinite recursion error when `copy_decompress_files_from_dir` was run in the current working directory.

### Operations

- `PH_KEYS` in Espresso calculator are now imported from ASE directly

## [0.4.6]

### Added

- The `WORKFLOW_ENGINE` quacc setting now accepts `None`.
- A `DEBUG` quacc setting as been added.

### Changed

- The way to run complex, dynamic flows has been modified to rely on `functools.partial()` instead of kwargs. See the updated documentation.
- Refactored test suite

## [0.4.5]

### Added

- Added ML interatomic potential recipes

### Changed

- ASE optimization log files and pickle files are written to disk by default
- Deprecated the old Q-Chem recipes and replaced them with the updated versions

### Removed

- Officially drop support of the Prefect workflow engine

## [0.4.4]

### Added

- Added core Quantum ESPRESSO recipes and custom calculator. (@tomdemeyere)
- Added a new function, `quacc.utils.files.copy_decompress_files_from_dir`

### Changed

- The `copy_files` kwarg in most recipes can now include a directory
- Renamed `quacc.utils.files.copy_decompress` to `quacc.utils.files.copy_decompress_files`

### Fixed

- Quacc settings that are paths now have `~/` expanded in most cases

## [0.4.3]

### Added

- Added preliminary support for the `Dask` workflow engine via Dask Delayed and Dask Distributed.

### Changed

- Renamed `CREATE_UNIQUE_WORKDIR` to `CREATE_UNIQUE_DIR` to better reflect its utility.
- The default for the `SCRATCH_DIR` setting is now `None` instead of `~/.quacc_scratch`. In other words, the default is to not use a scratch directory. This should help with onboarding, and the ability to set it as `None` may be broadly of interest. Setting the `SCRATCH_DIR` to a given `Path` will still work as expected.
- Files are no longer recursively _copied_ from `SCRATCH_DIR` to `RESULTS_DIR`. Instead, they are recursively moved. This should speed up I/O operations.

### Fixed

- Fixed a missing `phonopy_kwargs` keyword argument in `quacc.recipes.common.phonons`

## [0.4.2]

### Added

- Added a Jenkins-based test suite that runs tests on HPC resources without mocking for Gaussian, GULP, ORCA, and VASP (minimal)
- Added a TBLite phonon recipe

### Changed

- Changed the `auto_kpts` kwarg in the `Vasp` calculator to `pmg_kpts`
- Internal refactoring of recipes to have a separate `_base.py` module when appropriate
- Removed the unnecessary `Atoms` arg from the `calc_setup` function

### Fixed

- Fixed slow initial import (3 s --> 1 s)
- Fixed a few broken type hints
- Fixed functional and basis set strings in Gaussian recipes
- Uses number of physical cores instead of logical cores as default for molecular DFT recipes

## [0.4.1]

### Changed

- Switched to using the PyPI release of NewtonNet (1.1).
- NewtonNet recipes don't run a Hessian calculation by default unless needed

### Fixed

- Fixed circular import issue when running Q-Chem calculations.

### Removed

- Removed unsupported `qchem_internal_relax_job`

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- Added `quacc.recipes.common`, including `quacc.recipes.common.slabs`, `quacc.recipes.common.defects`, and `quacc.recipes.common.phonons`
- Added phonopy schema in `quacc.schemas.phonons`
- Added EMT phonon workflow

### Changed

- The method for specifying swaps to the default calculator arguments in recipes has been overhauled. In place of the previous `calc_swaps: dict` approach, additional parameters can be specified via the `**kwargs`. In practice, this means in recipes you can do `scf = "diis", max_steps=100` instead of `calc_swaps={"scf":"diis", "max_steps":100}`, for instance.
- Moved `quacc.runners.calc` to `quacc.runners.ase`
- Moved `quacc.runners.prep` to `quacc.schemas.prep`

- Psi4 recipes now use `uks` for unrestricted calculations instead of `uhf`.

## [0.1.2]

### Added

- Added support for Prefect.
- Added `quacc.wflow_tools` module.

### Changed
