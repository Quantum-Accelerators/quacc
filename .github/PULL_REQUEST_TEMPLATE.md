### Notes

- Your PR will likely not be merged without proper and thorough tests, even if it's for a "simple" fix.
- If you are an external contributor, you will see a comment from [@buildbot-princeton](https://github.com/buildbot-princeton). This is solely for the maintainers.
- When your code is ready for review, ping one of the [active maintainers](https://quantum-accelerators.github.io/quacc/about/contributors.html#active-maintainers).
