Quacc is a flexible platform for high-throughput, database-driven computational materials science and quantum chemistry.

Built around the [Atomic Simulation Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html) (ASE), Quacc seeks to:

1. Reduce the barrier for running complex, mixed-code workflows for molecules and materials across heterogeneous compute environments.

2. Promote rapid workflow development and testing via modern workflow managers, such as [Covalent](https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent).

3. Enable a seamless interface with much of the software infrastructure powering the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org).

In short, Quacc is designed to give the user the building blocks necessary to quickly prototype and construct complex quantum-chemical workflows without sacrificing flexibility.

**Disclaimer**: Currently, this package is under active development. Questions and bug reports are always welcome!

## Installation

Quacc can be installed as follows:

```bash
# For the current development version (recommended)
pip install git+https://github.com/arosen93/quacc.git

# For the latest PyPI release
pip install quacc
```

Then simply run `covalent start` to start the Covalent server and UI.

## Documentation

[Read me!](https://arosen93.github.io/quacc/)

## Minimal Example

```python
import covalent as ct
from ase.build import bulk
from quacc.recipes.emt.slabs import BulkToSlabsFlow

@ct.lattice
def workflow(atoms):
    relaxed_slabs = BulkToSlabsFlow().run(atoms)
    return relaxed_slabs

atoms = bulk("Cu")
dispatch_id = ct.dispatch(workflow)(atoms)
result = ct.get_result(dispatch_id)
```
