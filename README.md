QuAcc is a flexible platform for high-throughput, database-driven computational materials science and quantum chemistry.

Built around the [Atomic Simulation Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html) (ASE), QuAcc seeks to:

1. Reduce the barrier for running complex, mixed-code workflows for molecules and materials across heterogeneous compute environments.

2. Promote rapid workflow development and testing via modern workflow managers, such as [Covalent](https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent) and [Jobflow](https://github.com/materialsproject/jobflow).

3. Enable a seamless interface with much of the software infrastructure powering the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org).

**Disclaimer**: Currently, this package is under active development. Questions and bug reports are always welcome!

## Installation

QuAcc can be installed as follows:

```bash
# For the current development version (recommended)
pip install git+https://github.com/arosen93/quacc.git

# For the latest PyPI release
pip install quacc
```

## Examples

### VASP Job

```python
from ase.build import bulk

from quacc.recipes.vasp.core import relax_job as vasp_relax_job

# Make a bulk Cu structure
atoms = bulk("Cu")

# Make a job consisting of a VASP relaxation using a pre-defined input set.
# By default, VASP will be run using Custodian for on-the-fly error handling.
output = vasp_relax_job(atoms, preset="BulkSet")
print(output)
```

### GFN2-xTB + Gaussian + ORCA Workflow with Covalent

```python
import covalent as ct
from ase.build import molecule

from quacc.recipes.tblite.core import relax_job as xtb_relax_job
from quacc.recipes.gaussian.core import relax_job as gaussian_relax_job
from quacc.recipes.orca.core import static_job as orca_static_job

# Make an H2 molecule
atoms = molecule("H2")

# Make a workflow consisting of a GFN2-xTB relaxation followed by a Gaussian relaxation
# and then an ORCA static calculation using Covalent to manage the workflow.
@ct.lattice
def workflow(atoms):
    output1 = ct.electron(xtb_relax_job)(atoms, method="GFN2-xTB")
    output2 = ct.electron(gaussian_relax_job)(output1["atoms"], xc="PBE")
    output3 = ct.electron(orca_static_job)(output2["atoms"], xc="wB97M-V")
    return output3

# Run the workflow
dispatch_id = ct.dispatch(workflow)(atoms)
result = ct.get_result(dispatch_id, wait=True)
print(result)
```
