    Prepares the Atoms object for a new run.

    Depending on the arguments, this function will:
        - Move the converged magnetic moments to the initial magnetic moments.
        - Assign a unique ID to the Atoms object in atoms.info["_id"]. Any
          existing IDs will be moved to atoms.info["_old_ids"].

    In all cases, the calculator will be reset so new jobs can be run.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms
        Atoms object
    assign_id
        Whether to assign a unique ID to the Atoms object in atoms.info["_id"].
        Any existing IDs will be moved to atoms.info["_old_ids"].
    move_magmoms

    """
    Sets the initial magnetic moments in the Atoms object.

    This function deserves particular attention. The following logic is applied:
    - If there is a converged set of magnetic moments, those are moved to the
    initial magmoms if copy_magmoms is True. - If there is no converged set of
    magnetic moments but the user has set initial magmoms, those are simply used
    as is. - If there are no converged magnetic moments or initial magnetic
    moments, then the default magnetic moments from the preset
    elemental_mags_dict (if specified) are set as the initial magnetic moments.
    - For any of the above scenarios, if mag_cutoff is not None, the newly set
    initial magnetic moments are checked. If all have a magnitude below
    mag_cutoff, then they are all set to 0 (no spin polarization).

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms
        Atoms object
    elemental_mags_dict
        Dictionary of elemental symbols and their corresponding magnetic moments
        to set. If None, no default values will be used.
    elemental_mags_default
        Default magnetic moment on an element if no magnetic moment is specified
        in the elemental_mags_dict. Only used if elemental_mags_dict is not
        None. This kwarg is mainly a convenience so that you don't need to list
        every single element in the elemental_mags_dict.
    copy_magmoms
        Whether to copy the magnetic moments from the converged set of magnetic
        moments to the initial magnetic moments.
    mag_cutoff
        Magnitude below which the magnetic moments are considered to be zero. If
        None, no cutoff will be applied
