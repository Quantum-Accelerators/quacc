    # and the first and last images contains spin state. Running
    # the first singlepoint with fresh wavefunctions might end up
    # in a different spin state, screwing up the whole NEB calculation.

    # Probably the best way is to have a recipe that only does sanity checks
    # with a different runner (local) and then the actual calculation with
    # the HPC runner. This way we can also check if the calculation is
    # going to fail.

    #      is wrong i.e. if image parallelization is used but the number of
    #      images is not a multiple of the number of cores or similar
    # quacc will not be able to prevent the third kind of error
    #   3 - everything is correct but the calculation fail for non-technical reasons
    # Although quacc should be able to detect it and fail the calculation. It is also
    # necessary to be able to restart the calculation in the simplest and best way authorized by each binary.
    # i.e. if the calculation fails because of a walltime limit, quacc should be able to
    # restart the calculation without too much interaction from the user.
