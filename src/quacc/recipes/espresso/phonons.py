    Function to carry out a basic ph.x calculation. It should allow you to

    `ph.x` calculates the dynamical matrix at a set of q-points within the Density
    Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) framework. The dynamical matrix is used to calculate the phonon frequencies and eigenvectors. Various other properties can be
    calculated using other post-processing tools.

    Parameters
    ----------
    copy_files
        Source directory or directories to copy files from. If a `SourceDirectory` or a
        list of `SourceDirectory` is provided, this interface will automatically guess
        which files have to be copied over by looking at the binary and `input_data`.
        If a dict is provided, the mode is manual, keys are source directories and values
        are relative path to files or directories to copy. Glob patterns are supported.
    prev_outdir
        The output directory of a previous calculation. If provided, Quantum Espresso
        will directly read the necessary files from this directory, eliminating the need
        to manually copy files. The directory will be ungzipped if necessary.
    parallel_info
        Dictionary containing information about the parallelization of the
        calculation. See the ASE documentation for more information.
    test_run
        If True, a test run is performed to check that the calculation input_data is correct or
        to generate some files/info if needed.
    use_phcg
        If True, the calculation is performed using the `phcg.x` code which uses a faster algorithm.
        It can be used only if you sample the Brillouin Zone at Gamma and you only need the phonon
        modes at Gamma (molecules typically). It cannot be used with spin-polarization, USPP and PAW.
    **calc_kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to the Espresso calculator. Set a value to
        `quacc.Remove` to remove a pre-existing key entirely. See the docstring of
        [quacc.calculators.espresso.espresso.Espresso][] for more information.

    This function performs grid parallelization of a ph.x calculation. Each
    representation of each q-point is calculated in a separate job, allowing for
    distributed computation across different machines and times.

    The grid parallelization is a technique to make phonon calculation embarrassingly
    parallel. This function should return similar results to
    [quacc.recipes.espresso.phonons.phonon_job][]. If you don't know about
    grid parallelization please consult the Quantum Espresso user manual and
    exemples.

    This approach requires the data of the pw.x calculation to be copied to each job,
    leading to a total data size on the disk of n*m times the size of the pw.x calculation, where:
    - n is the number of q-points
    - m is the number of representations

    In addition to the data produced by each ph.x calculation. This can
    result in large data sizes for systems with many atoms.

    To mitigate this, an optional "nblocks" argument can be provided. This
    groups multiple representations together in a single job, reducing the
    data size by a factor of nblocks, but also reducing the level of parallelization.
    In the case of nblocks = 0, each job will contain all the representations for each q-point.

    1. pw.x relaxation

    Parameters
    ----------

        Atoms object
    nblocks
        The number of representations to group together in a single job.
        This will reduce the amount of data produced by a factor of nblocks.

    Function to carry out a basic postahc calculation. It should allow you to
    use all the features of the [postahc.x binary](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/INPUT_POSTAHC.html#idm11)

    Calculate the phonon-induced electron self-energy in the full matrix form
    at a given temperature. This requires the results of a previous ph.x calculation
    with `electron_phonon='ahc'`

    self energies calculated and printed by `postahc.x`

    - Total self-energy in the on-shell approximation (OSA)
    - Debye-Waller self-energy in the RIA
    - Total Fan self-energy in the OSA
    - Upper Fan self-energy
    - Lower Fan self-energy in the OSA

    ----------
    copy_files
        Source directory or directories to copy files from. If a `SourceDirectory` or a

        which files have to be copied over by looking at the binary and `input_data`.
        If a dict is provided, the mode is manual, keys are source directories and values
        are relative path to files or directories to copy. Glob patterns are supported.
    prev_outdir
        The output directory of a previous calculation. If provided, Quantum Espresso
        will directly read the necessary files from this directory, eliminating the need
        to manually copy files. The directory will be ungzipped if necessary.
    parallel_info
